# School Challenge - Demo Project

This is a minimal React + Vite demo that implements the requested challenge:
- Screen 1: Students (filters by degree and class, edit name/class, add +300 students distributed, chart per degree)
- Screen 2: Teachers / Relationships (list relationships, filters, show students for a degree, form to add new relationship)

## How to run

1. Make sure you have Node.js >= 16 and npm installed.
2. In project root:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
3. Open http://localhost:5173

The `src/data` folder contains the JSONs you uploaded and the app uses them as mocked data.

Notes:
- This is a small demo app meant to jumpstart your implementation. It focuses on functionality rather than production structure.
